Beta Policy
---

Reimplement the paper: **ï»¿Improving Stochastic Policy Gradients in Continuous Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning using the Beta Distribution** on `MountainCarContinuous-v0`

Note that the model is not very stable, if you find any tricks that can make it stable, please keep me informed.
